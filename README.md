# legendre_polynomials
Subroutines in Fortran2008 for generating associated Legendre polynomials at given points

This repo contains two files *.f90. 

-legendre_routines.f90 contains the two subroutines for generating associated Legendre polynomials (quadruple precision used).

-prova_legendre.f90 is the main of the program, used for testing legendre_routines.f90 and producing an output.
